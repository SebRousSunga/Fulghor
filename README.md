# FULGHOR


## Description

Fulghor is a practice project for a music recommendation website written in Typescript, utilizing React for front end and an Express-oriented backend, with most likely using the Spotify API to deal with the actual main application work. At most, the funcitonality would be allowing users to enter a song, album, artist, or genre, and then receive similar songs to the user input.


### Why?

Mostly for practice. I wanted to get familar with Typescript and handle more api usage. Possibly machine learning also and to see if I can utilize Python also to deal with getting music recommendations.
